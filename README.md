GeoBlacklight is a world-class discovery platform for geospatial (GIS) holdings. It
is an open collaborative project aiming to build off of the successes
of the [Blacklight](https://projectblacklight.org) Solr-powered discovery interface and the
multi-institutional [OpenGeoportal](http://opengeoportal.io/) and [OpenGeoMetadata](https://github.com/opengeometadata) federated metadata sharing
communities. We're actively looking for community input and development partners.

### Documentation

Our full [GeoBlacklight Documentation](https://geoblacklight.org/docs/) has how-to guides for installing, customizing, and maintaining a GeoBlacklight instance.

See the [Quick Start](https://geoblacklight.org/docs/geoblacklight_quick_start/) section to create a new GeoBlacklight application, or see [For Developers](https://geoblacklight.org/docs/developers/) for more information about setting up a development environment.
