### Contributing code or documentation
GeoBlacklight welcomes code and documentation contributions. You do *not* need to be a "GeoBlacklight Committer" to contribute code or documentation. We follow the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) model for contributing on GitHub. GeoBlacklight uses a suite of tests to express its features and protect from bugs:bug:.

When proposing major new features or changes that may introduce an API or schema change, please make sure to communicate with the [community](http://geoblacklight.org/connect) so the full implications are understood. Likely there are ways to introduce these changes in a backwards compatible way that others may be able to help with.

#### Pull request overview
1. Fork it ( http://github.com/my-github-username/geoblacklight/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

#### Merging Changes

- It is considered "poor form" to merge your own request.
- Please take the time to review the changes and get a sense of what is being changed. Things to consider:
  - Does the commit message explain what is going on?
  - Does the code changes have tests? _Not all changes need new tests, some changes are refactorings_
  - Do all new methods, modules, and classes have comments? Do changed methods, modules, and classes have comments?
  - Does the commit contain more than it should? Are two separate concerns being addressed in one commit?
  - Did the GitHub Actions CI tests complete successfully?
- Bring the [GeoBlacklight Developers Team](https://github.com/orgs/geoblacklight/teams/geoblacklight-developers) into the conversation by creating a comment that tags their @username: `@geoblacklight/geoblacklight-developers`.
- If you like the pull request, but want others to chime in, create a +1 comment and tag a user.
